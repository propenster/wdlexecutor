# WDL Executor

WDL Executor built with love using [Rust](https://rustlang.org) runs Cromwell institute's WDL pipelines. WDL pipelines are based on the Workflow Definition Language pipeline for bioinformatics and genomic exploration.

- This is an attempt at making the fastest WDL pipeline runner yet without help from anyone not even The Broad Institute - the creator of cromwell and gatk, and lest I forget, in the smallest number of LOCs possible.

- Rust == 10000 * JAVA [:lol] Ratio this statement.

## Features
- WDL parser (This is very important)
- WDL runner/executor that just takes a WDL file and executes whatever is inside
- WDL ratioer (WDL jokes and funny stuff)
